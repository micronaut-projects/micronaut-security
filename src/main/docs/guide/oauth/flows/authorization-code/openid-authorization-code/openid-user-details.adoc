Because the OpenID standard returns a JWT token in the token response, it is possible to retrieve information about the user without having to make an additional call. In addition, the data stored in the JWT is standardized so you can use the same code to retrieve that information across providers.

A default implementation of api:security.oauth2.endpoint.token.response.OpenIdUserDetailsMapper[] has been provided for you to map the JWT token to a api:security.authentication.UserDetails[]. The default implementation will carry over any of the specific OpenID JWT claims, as well as potentially include other claims based on configuration. The original provider name will always be included in the JWT with the claim key "oauth2Provider". The following table explains the additional claims.

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.security.oauth2.configuration.OauthConfigurationProperties$OpenIdConfigurationProperties$AdditionalClaimsConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

IMPORTANT: Enabling all of the above with cookie JWT storage has been known to cause issues with Keycloak due to their tokens being very large and causing the resulting cookie to be larger than what browsers allow.

If the default implementation is not sufficient, it is possible to override the global default or provide an implementation specific to a provider.

To override the global default mapper, register a bean that replaces api:security.oauth2.endpoint.token.response.DefaultOpenIdUserDetailsMapper[].

To override the user detail mapping behavior for a specific provider, register a bean with a named qualifier with a value equal to the name specified in the client configuration.

snippet::io.micronaut.security.oauth2.docs.openid.OktaUserDetailsMapper[tags="clazz"]

<1> The named qualifier is added that matches the name in configuration
<2> The provider name is passed to the method. Only useful for the global version
<3> The full token response is available
<4> The JWT claims are available
<5> The state object used during OAuth authentication
<6> An instance of api:security.authentication.Authentication[] is returned
