Beyond configuration, an implementation of api:security.oauth2.endpoint.token.response.OauthUserDetailsMapper[] is required by the user to be implemented. The implementation must be qualified by name that matches the name present in the client configuration.

The purpose of the user details mapper is to transform the api:security.oauth2.endpoint.token.response.TokenResponse[] into a api:security.authentication.UserDetails[]. That will entail calling some endpoint the provider exposes to retrieve the user's information. Once that information is received, the user details can be populated per your requirements.

Common requirements of a user details mapper may be to combine data from the OAuth 2.0 provider with data from a remote database and/or create new user records. The api:security.authentication.UserDetails[] object stores three basic properties: username, roles, and arbitrary attributes. All data stored in the user details will be retrievable in controllers that accept an api:security.authentication.Authentication[].

For example, here is how it might be implemented for Github:

snippet::io.micronaut.security.oauth2.docs.github.GithubUser,io.micronaut.security.oauth2.docs.github.GithubApiClient,io.micronaut.security.oauth2.docs.github.GithubUserDetailsMapper[tags="clazz", project="security-oauth2"]

<1> The bean must have a named qualifier that matches the name in configuration.
<2> How the request is made to retrieve the user information is totally up to you, however in this example we're using a declarative client.
<3> The token endpoint response is passed to the method.
<4> The user information is converted to a api:security.authentication.UserDetails[].
