> https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect 1.0] is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

If you are new to OpenID Connect, we recommend watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=996OiexHze0[OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect] to get a better understanding.

NOTE: To use OpenID client flows, the `security-jwt` dependency must be in your build because OpenID relies on JWT tokens.

dependency:io.micronaut.security:micronaut-security-jwt[]

IMPORTANT: Even though OpenID providers return JWT tokens, that token is not used directly to authorize requests with Micronaut by default. Instead a new token is created if the application is using JWT. This allows for authorization to be standardized across custom authentication providers, normal OAuth 2.0 flows, and OpenID flows. It also allows for purely session based authorization as a result of OpenID authentication. To use the provider token directly, set the authentication mode to `idtoken`.
