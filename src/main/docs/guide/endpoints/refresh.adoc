IMPORTANT: The refresh token functionality has changed dramatically starting in Micronaut Security 2.0. Please read this section if you are upgrading as it now behaves differently.

Refresh tokens can be used to obtain a new access token. By default, refresh tokens are not generated.

The api:security.token.generator.RefreshTokenGenerator[] API is responsible for generating the token that gets included in the response. The api:security.token.generator.RefreshTokenValidator[] is responsible for validating the refresh token. Note that this validation step is not related to the persistence of the token, but instead is intended to verify the token is not a random/guessed value.

An implementation of both api:security.token.generator.RefreshTokenGenerator[] and  api:security.token.validator.RefreshTokenValidator[] has been provided by default. The api:io.micronaut.security.token.jwt.generator.SignedRefreshTokenGenerator[] creates and verifies a JWS (JSON web signature) encoded object whose payload is a UUID with a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). See the following configuration options:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.security.token.jwt.generator.RefreshTokenConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

To enable it, you must provide a secret:

```yaml
micronaut:
    security:
        token:
            jwt:
                generator:
                    refresh-token:
                        secret: 'pleaseChangeThisSecretForANewOne'
```

After a token is generated, this library has no knowledge of it. The value is not cached or stored anywhere. It is up to each application to decide how to store the token, support revocation, and retrieve user details when given a token.

In addition to the above requirements, each application must provide an implementation of api:security.token.refresh.RefreshTokenPersistence[].

The api:security.token.refresh.RefreshTokenPersistence[] implementation will receive an event when a refresh token is generated and then is responsible for persisting the token along with a link to the user that it was generated for. The user information and the token are both available in the api:security.token.event.RefreshTokenGeneratedEvent[].

### Refreshing the Token

Micronaut security comes with a controller to allow for the refresh of access tokens. The context loads the api:security.token.jwt.endpoints.OauthController[OauthController] if your context contains beans of type: api:io.micronaut.security.token.jwt.generator.AccessRefreshTokenGenerator[], api:security.token.refresh.RefreshTokenPersistence[], api:security.token.validator.RefreshTokenValidator[]

Moreover, the controller can be configured with:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.security.token.jwt.endpoints.OauthControllerConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

The controller exposes an endpoint as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6[section 6 of the OAuth 2.0 spec] - Refreshing an Access Token.

The refresh token endpoint uses the api:security.token.validator.RefreshTokenValidator[] API to verify the token matches the format that is expected. api:io.micronaut.security.token.jwt.generator.SignedRefreshTokenGenerator[] attempts to verify the signature and returns the payload. Any validator implementations should not be concerned with revocation status, existence, or any other persistence related validation.

If the validator successfully validates the token, it is then passed to a api:security.token.refresh.RefreshTokenPersistence[] implementation, which each application must provide. A new access token is then created from the user details returned by `RefreshTokenPersistence::getUserDetails` and then sent in the response.

Here is an example of a refresh token request. Send a POST request to the `/oauth/access_token` endpoint:

[source,bash]
.Sample HTTP request to obtain an access token
----
POST /oauth/access_token HTTP/1.1
Host: micronaut.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ....
----

As you can see, is a form request with 2 parameters:

`grant_type`: must be `refresh_token` always.

`refresh_token`: the refresh token obtained previously.

TIP: Refresh tokens must be securely stored in your client application.
