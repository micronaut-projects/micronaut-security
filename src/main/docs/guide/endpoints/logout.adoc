To enable the logout controller you need a bean of type api:security.handlers.LogoutHandler[]. The behaviour of the controller is delegated to it.
A custom implementation can, of course, be provided. However, several <<logoutHandler, Logout Handler>>s implementations are available out of the box.

You can configure the logout endpoint with:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.security.endpoints.LogoutControllerConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

TIP: If you are using JWT authentication not stored in a cookie, you may not need to invoke the `/logout` endpoint. Since logging out normally means simply deleting the JWT token in the client.
