Micronaut security capabilities use signed JWTâ€™s as specified by the
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515[JSON Web Signature] specification.

Micronaut's JWT validation supports multiple signature configurations. Thus, you can validate JSON Web tokens signed by different issuers in the same application.

To verify the signature of JWT tokens, you need beans of type link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/SignatureConfiguration.html[SignatureConfiguration].

The easiest way is to create a bean of type link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/SignatureConfiguration.html[SignatureConfiguration] is to have in your app a bean of type link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/rsa/RSASignatureConfiguration.html[RSASignatureConfiguration],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/ec/ECSignatureConfiguration.html[ECSignatureConfiguration], or
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] which must be https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#qualifiers[qualified] with `@Named` since the configuration beans are used by factories (link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/rsa/RSASignatureFactory.html[RSASignatureFactory],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/ec/ECSignatureConfiguration.html[ECSignatureFactory]) or other beans (link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignature.html[SecretSignature])  which use
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#eachBean[@EachBean] to drive configuration.
