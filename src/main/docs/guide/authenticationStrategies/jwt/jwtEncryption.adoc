Signed claims prevent an attacker from tampering with its contents to introduce malicious data or try a privilege escalation by adding more roles. However, the claims can be decoded just by using Base 64.

If the claims contain sensitive information, you can use a JSON Web Encryption algorithm to prevent them from being decoded.

Micronaut's JWT validation supports multiple encryption configurations.

Beans of type link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/encryption/rsa/RSAEncryptionConfiguration.html[RSAEncryptionConfiguration],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/encryption/ec/ECEncryptionConfiguration.html[ECEncryptionConfiguration],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/encryption/secret/SecretEncryptionConfiguration.html[SecretEncryptionConfiguration] participate as encryption configurations in the JWT validation.

Those beans need to be https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#qualifiers[qualified] with `@Named` since the configuration beans are used by factories (link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/encryption/rsa/RSAEncryptionFactory.html[RSAEncryptionFactory],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/encryption/ec/ECEncryptionFactory.html[ECEncryptionFactory]) or other beans (link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/encryption/secret/SecretEncryptionFactory.html[SecretEncryptionFactory])  which use
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#eachBean[@EachBean] to drive configuration.

Use `generator` as the `@Named` qualifier if you want to use encryption configuration in the tokens your app generates.

The API link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/validator/JsonWebTokenEncryption.html[JsonWebTokenEncryption] allows you to decrypt an encrypted token.
