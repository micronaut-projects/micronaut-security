Micronaut security capabilities use signed JWTâ€™s as specified by the
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515[JSON Web Signature] specification.

To enable a JWT signature in token generation, you need to have in your app a bean of type link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/SignatureGeneratorConfiguration.html[SignatureGeneratorConfiguration]
qualified with name `generator`.

To verify signed JWT tokens, you need to have in your app a bean of type link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/rsa/RSASignatureConfiguration.html[RSASignatureConfiguration],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/rsa/RSASignatureGeneratorConfiguration.html[RSASignatureGeneratorConfiguration],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/ec/ECSignatureGeneratorConfiguration.html[ECSignatureGeneratorConfiguration],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/ec/ECSignatureConfiguration.html[ECSignatureConfiguration], or
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignature.html[SecretSignature].

You can setup a `SecretSignatureConfiguration` named `generator` easily via configuration properties:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testssecurityjwt}/signandencrypt/SignSecretEncryptRSASpec.groovy[indent=0, tag=yamlconfig]
----

<1> **Change this for your own secret and keep it safe**.
<2> Json Web Token Signature name. In this example, HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm.

You can supply the secret with Base64 encoding.

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testssecurityjwt}/base64/JwtBase64Spec.groovy[indent=0, tag=yamlconfig]
----

<1> Secret Base64 encoded
<2> Signal that the secret is Base64 encoded

A programmatic setup of a RSA signature generation may look like

[source, groovy]
----
include::{testssecurityjwt}/signandencrypt/MySignatureGeneratorConfigurationFactory.groovy[indent=0, tag=clazz]
----

<1> Name the SignatureGeneratorConfiguration `generator` to make it participate in JWT token generation.
<2> Register an additional bean of type RSASignatureGeneratorConfiguration which is injected here
