You can setup a link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] qualified with `@Named` `generator` easily via configuration:

[configuration]
----
include::{testssecurityjwt}/signandencrypt/SignSecretEncryptRSASpec.groovy[indent=0, tag=yamlconfig]
----

<1> **Change the `secret` property to your own secret and keep it safe**.
<2> `jws-algorithm` specifies the Json Web Token Signature name. In this example, HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm.

You can supply the secret with Base64 encoding.

[configuration]
----
include::{testssecurityjwt}/base64/JwtBase64Spec.groovy[indent=0, tag=yamlconfig]
----

<1> This example of `secret` is Base64 encoded
<2> Set `base64` to signal that the secret is Base64 encoded
