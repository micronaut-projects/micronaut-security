All authorization strategies implement the api:security.filters.AuthenticationFetcher[] interface. The contract is designed to return an api:security.authentication.Authentication[] from the request. To implement custom logic to retrieve the currently logged in user, simply create a bean that implements the contract and it will be picked up automatically.

For example, if you use a product like https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security/identity/siteminder[SiteMinder] that handles authentication for you, you can trust that users access your application are authenticated, and you can access their username via the `SM_USER` request header and build an `Authentication` from that:
