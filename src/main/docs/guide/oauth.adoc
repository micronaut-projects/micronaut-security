This project eases OAuth 2.0 integration with Micronaut.

Micronaut supports integration with authentication & authorization platforms such as https://developer.okta.com[Okta], https://auth0.com[Auth0], https://aws.amazon.com/cognito[AWS Cognito], https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak], etc.

Once you create an application client with a provider, you will get a Client ID and optionally a Client Secret.

The previous image shows how to get an client id and client secret with AWS Cognito. Please, note you can obtain similar credentials with other providers.

Once, you get the `client_id` and `client_secret` configure the OAuth 2.0 configuration:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.security.oauth2.configuration.OauthConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

For example, if you configured:

[source, yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
micronaut:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client-secret: '${OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}'
      client-id: '${OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}'
----

You can supply two environment variables `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` with the credentials you obtained from the provider to be used as values of `micronaut.security.oauth2.client-id` and `micronaut.security.oauth2.client-secret`.
