The built-in <<login, Login Controller>> uses every available authentication provider. The first provider that returns a successful authentication response will have its value used as the basis for the JWT token or session state.

Basic authentication which is implemented as an api:security.filters.AuthenticationFetcher[] will also trigger the available api:security.authentication.AuthenticationProvider[]s.
