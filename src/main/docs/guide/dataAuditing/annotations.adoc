The annotations `@CreatedBy` and `@UpdatedBy` annotations are provided for application to your Micronaut Data entities. The annotated fields will be automatically populated with the currently authenticated user's identity. For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.security.audit.docs.createdby.Book[tags="clazz"]
<1> The class is mapped and persisted by Micronaut Data
<2> The creator field will be populated on `save()`
<3> The editor field will be populated on both `save()` and `update()`
