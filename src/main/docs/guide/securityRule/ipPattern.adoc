When you turn on security, traffic coming from any ip address is allowed by default.

You can however reject traffic not coming from a white list of IP Patterns as illustrated below:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testssecurity}/security/securityRule/IpPatternSpec.groovy[tag=yamlconfig,indent=0]
----

In the previous code, the link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/rules/IpPatternsRule.html[IpPatternsRule] rejects traffic not coming
either `127.0.0.1` or `192.168.1.*` range.

The IP patterns rule never explicitly allows requests, it only rejects requests if the address does not match. There must be other security rules that determine whether a resource should be accessed.

If the desired behavior is to allow access to all resources as long as the address matches, create a security rule that executes after this one that returns `ALLOWED`.
