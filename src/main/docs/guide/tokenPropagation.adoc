Imagine you have a Gateway microservice which consumes three other microservices:

image::tokenpropagation.svg[]

If the incoming request `localhost:8080/api/books` contains a valid JWT token, you may want to propagate
that token to other requests in your network.

You can configure token propagation to achieve that.

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testssecurity}/security/token/propagation/TokenPropagationSpec.groovy[tag=yamlconfig,indent=0]
----

The previous configuration, configures a link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/writer/HttpHeaderTokenWriter.html[HttpHeaderTokenWriter] and a
and a propagation filter, link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/propagation/TokenPropagationHttpClientFilter.html[TokenPropagationHttpClientFilter], which
will propagate the security token seamlessly.

If you use <<serviceDiscovery, Service Discovery>> features, you can use the service id in your service id regular expression:

[source, bash]
----
micronaut.security.token.propagation.service-id-regex="catalogue|recommendations|inventory"
----
