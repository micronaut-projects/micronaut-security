[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply either the `security-jwt` or `security-session` features configure the security support in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features security-jwt
----
====
To use the Micronaut's security capabilities you must have the `security` dependency on your classpath:

dependency:io.micronaut.security:micronaut-security-annotations[scope='annotationProcessor']

dependency:io.micronaut.security:micronaut-security-jwt[]

NOTE: The `micronaut-security-annotations` dependency is only required to use JSR 250 annotations

By default Micronaut returns HTTP Status Unauthorized (401) for any endpoint invocation. Routes must be explicitly allowed through the provided mechanisms.
