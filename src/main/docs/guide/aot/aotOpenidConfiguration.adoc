When you use <<oauth,OpenID Connect>> in a Micronaut application, the application constructs a URL by appending `.well-known/openid-configuration` to the value you specify for each OAuth 2.0 client via
`micronaut.security.oauth2.clients.*.openid.issuer`. It visits the URL to fetch OpenID Connect metadata related to the specified authorization server and configure itself.

However, this is a network request which may be slow. Moreover, the application will probably need to execute this network request to serve the first request.

You can use Micronaut Security ahead-of-time build optimizations to do the request at build-time.

To enable this optimization, add
`micronaut.security.openid-configuration.enabled=true` to `aot.properties`.

WARNING: The application uses the configuration present at the authorization server at build time. The configuration may be out-of-date if the authorization server changes the configuration between the build time and the application startup.
