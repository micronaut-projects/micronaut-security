Micronaut security supports JWKS (JSON Web Key Sets) either specifying them <<jwks, directly>> or via the `jwks_uri` obtained when fetching the OpenID Connect metadata. Micronaut security uses JWKS to validate the signature of tokens issued by another application or an authorization server.

Micronaut applications need to make a network request To fetch JWKS.   You can use Micronaut Security ahead-of-time build optimizations to make the request at build-time.

To enable this optimization, add
`micronaut.security.jwks.enabled.enabled=true` to `aot.properties`.
