The decision to allow access to a particular endpoint to anonymous or authenticated users is determined by a collection of
Security Rules. Micronaut ships with several built-in security rules. If they don't fulfil your needs,
you can implement your own link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/rules/SecurityRule.html[SecurityRule] or link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/rules/ReactiveSecurityRule.tml[ReactiveSecurityRule]. You should use the Reactive variant and subscribe on another thread pool if you need to do any blocking work in order to not block the netty event loop.

Security rules implement the ordered interface and they are executed in order. All of the existing rules have a static variable `ORDER` that stores the order of that rule. You can use those variables to place your own rule before or after any of the existing rules.

Security rules return a api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult[] while Reactive security rules return a publisher of api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult[]. See the following table for a description of each result.

|===
|Result |Description

|api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult#ALLOWED[ALLOWED]
|Access to the resource should be granted and no further rules will be considered.

|api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult#REJECTED[REJECTED]
|Access to the resource should be rejected and no further rules will be considered.

|api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult#UNKNOWN[UNKNOWN]
|The rule doesn't apply to the request resource, or it cannot be determined either way. This result will cause other security rules to be considered.
|===

IMPORTANT: If all security rules return `UNKNOWN`, the request will be rejected!
