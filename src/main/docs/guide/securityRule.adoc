The decision to allow access to a particular endpoint to anonymous or authenticated users is determined by a collection of
Security Rules. Micronaut ships with several built-in security rules. If they don't fulfil your needs,
you can implement your own link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/rules/SecurityRule.html[SecurityRule].

Security rules implement the ordered interface and they are executed in order. All of the existing rules have a static variable `ORDER` that stores the order of that rule. You can use those variables to place your own rule before or after any of the existing rules.

Security rules return a api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult[]. See the following table for a description of each result.

|===
|Result |Description

|api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult#ALLOWED[ALLOWED]
|Access to the resource should be granted and no further rules will be considered.

|api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult#REJECTED[REJECTED]
|Access to the resource should be rejected and no further rules will be considered.

|api:security.rules.SecurityRuleResult#UNKNOWN[UNKNOWN]
|The rule doesn't apply to the request resource, or it cannot be determined either way. This result will cause other security rules to be considered.
|===

IMPORTANT: If all security rules return `UNKNOWN`, the request will be rejected!
