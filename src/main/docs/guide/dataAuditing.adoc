Micronaut Security provides integration with https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/[Micronaut Data] for automatically capturing the identity of the user that created or updated a particular entity.

To enable this support, you must include the `security-audit` module on your classpath. For example:
dependency:io.micronaut.security:micronaut-security-audit[]
