By default, when you include Micronaut security the app returns 401 or 403 even for non existing routes. The behavior prevents attackers from discovering what endpoints are available in your application. However, if you wish to return 404 for non found routes you can set `micronaut.security.reject-not-found: false` in your configuration.
